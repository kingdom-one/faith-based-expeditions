# Faith Based Expeditions

A custom child theme of [Pro Theme by Themeco](https://theme.co/pro).

## Getting Started (Developers)

-   Take a look at the `src` folder for all front-end styles/code.
-   Take a look inside the `includes` folder for all PHP related code.

If you're looking to make changes and you're not a developer with Kingdom One, `style.css` and `functions.php` will behave as normal. Edit at your own risk!
